The tool has been developed by the Chief Analyst Division at National Highways who are looking to make more granular historic journey time information publicly available (May, 2022)</li>
				<li>I have provided expert support to the Open Innovation Team of the Cabinet Office on the use of geospatial data in the transportation sector. The Open Innovation Team are working on behalf of the Geospatial Commission, who are interested in consulting external experts on a range of themes related to the collection, dissemination and use of geospatial data. This work will build on the recent publication of the National Geospatial Strategy, which commits the Commission to publishing new guidelines for the ethical use of location data and technology. The report they produced as a result of the interviews was sent on to the client team at the Geospatial Commission, and is now informing the work they are doing in this area <a href="./OIT.pdf">[letter]</a> (August, 2020)</li>

				<li>*As part of a <a href="https://research.aber.ac.uk/en/projects/wales-randomised-optimisation-algorithms-network-win">Welsh Government networking grant</a> led by Christine Zarges at Aberystwyth University, I was invited to participate in a one-day networking meeting in Cardiff and another in Bangor. The networking project was inspired by the recently established COST Action CA22137. Our discussions focused on establishing a similar UK-wide network to bridge the gap between academia, industry, and policymakers. This initiative aims to advance and apply randomised optimisation heuristics across various domains (2024) <a href="./GQ7TyJZWoAAYq2g.jpeg">[pic]</a></li>
				
				<li>*Invited to participate in a research retreat organised by the newly formed Geospatial Data Science Group at the Data Science Institute (DSI), Lancaster University. The retreat brought together academics engaged in the creation, visualisation, or analysis of spatial data. The event aimed to identify strengths, synergies, and new opportunities for research through exciting new interdisciplinary collaborations (2024)</li>
